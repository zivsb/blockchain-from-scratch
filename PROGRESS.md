# Blockchain from the Ground Up, a Learning Project

# Week 4
Aim to build and start implementing a cryptocurrency on top of the blockchain. I hope to implement basic wallets and keys this week.

# Week 3
Spent excessive time researching peer to peer networks and implementation and ended up implementing a publisher-subscriber pattern through redis instead. Implemented a chatt app through redis to understand the pub/sub patter then used similar logic and applied it to the blockchain network.

# Week 2

 - [x] Create test cases for a robust block class
 - [x] Create a first iteration of the block class
 - [x] Pass the test block classes test cases
 - [x] Start the chaining process in the blockchain class

# Week 1

 - Figured out the project I wanted to create
 - Found good articles and educational references for node.js, blockchain, and hashing
 - Created a basic implementation of a blockchain on node.js that showcases blocks, simple hashing, and data storing
