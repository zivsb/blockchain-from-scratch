# Blockchain from the Ground Up, a Learning Project
# Week 5
Aim to figure out the elliptic module and implement keys and transactions.

# Week 4
Researched elliptic cryptography online and attempted to implement it through the elliptic module but have been running into compiler error after compiler error as I tried to implement public and private key cryptographies.

# Week 3
Spent excessive time researching peer to peer networks and implementation and ended up implementing a publisher-subscriber pattern through redis instead. Implemented a chatt app through redis to understand the pub/sub patter then used similar logic and applied it to the blockchain network.

# Week 2

 - [x] Create test cases for a robust block class
 - [x] Create a first iteration of the block class
 - [x] Pass the test block classes test cases
 - [x] Start the chaining process in the blockchain class

# Week 1

 - Figured out the project I wanted to create
 - Found good articles and educational references for node.js, blockchain, and hashing
 - Created a basic implementation of a blockchain on node.js that showcases blocks, simple hashing, and data storing
