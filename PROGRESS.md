# Blockchain from the Ground Up, a Learning Project

# Week 8
Start implementing a front end on react and try to deploy the app again.

# Week 7
Finalized the API, mining algorithm, and backend as a whole. Presented an mvp to the class. Multiple attempts to deploy through heroku but resulted in crashes. Looked into creating a front end with react.

# Week 6
Aim to Implement a transaction miner class that can validate and broadcast a given transaction pool.
Transaction miner should: check and validate each transaction in the pool, generate a reward for the miner, broadcast the new blockchain, and clear the transaction pool after validating the transactions.

Implemented API methods such as ways to view addresses' possessed currency and supporting functionallity such as mining rewards, ways to calculate balances, and ways to clear mined transactions.

# Week 5
Implemented individual transactions along with a transaction pool. Implemented the transaction pool and transaction broadcasting into the main app.

# Week 4
Researched elliptic cryptography online and attempted to implement it through the elliptic module but have been running into compiler error after compiler error as I tried to implement public and private key cryptographies.

# Week 3
Spent excessive time researching peer to peer networks and implementation and ended up implementing a publisher-subscriber pattern through redis instead. Implemented a chatt app through redis to understand the pub/sub patter then used similar logic and applied it to the blockchain network.

# Week 1

 - Figured out the project I wanted to create
 - Found good articles and educational references for node.js, blockchain, and hashing
 - Created a basic implementation of a blockchain on node.js that showcases blocks, simple hashing, and data storing
